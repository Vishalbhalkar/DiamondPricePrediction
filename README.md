# Diamond Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Diamond Price Prediction** project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the price of diamonds based on various attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and other physical properties. This project leverages data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to provide accurate price estimations.

## 🔧 Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vishalbhalkar/DiamondPricePrediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DiamondPricePrediction
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information on various diamonds with attributes such as:
- **Carat** - Weight of the diamond
- **Cut** - Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)
- **Color** - Diamond color grading (D to J)
- **Clarity** - Measure of inclusions (I1, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF)
- **Depth & Table** - Proportions of the diamond
- **Price** - Price in US dollars (Target variable)
- **X, Y, Z** - Dimensions of the diamond

## 🏗️ Usage
Run the following command to train the model:
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```
To make predictions:
```bash
python src/predict.py --input sample_input.csv
```

If a web application is implemented, start the app using:
```bash
python app.py
```
Then, open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
